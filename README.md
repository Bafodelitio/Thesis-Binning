Code used in the development of the thesis "Exploring Graph Neural Networks for Metagenomic Assembly Graphs"

1. Install requirements.txt
2. Add the folder with the datasets in use to the same directory as the repository code (change the names as well as the "data_dir" in the beginning of SAGE_unsup.py accordingly)
3. Run SAGE_unsup.py (play with the base_config parameters and the value lists for each parameter)
